1. Accesses the [Movie Databases API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to display now playing movies.
2. UICollectionView Cells that hold movie thumbnails and titles can be tapped to reveal: A. a description and  B: a link to reviews (In progress). 
3. Retrieves songs from movies when cells are tapped [(In progress)](https://github.com/bereket6725/MovieHound/issues/2)


Going to use a [library](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) to Cache the poster images instead of having a custom one
